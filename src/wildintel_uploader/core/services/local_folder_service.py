"""Organizing a deployment into a local "collection" folder instead of
Trapper — the "Local folder" destination, for when there's no Trapper
account/instance involved at all.

A collection here is just a folder holding one subfolder per deployment,
with a small collection.json recording its own name (mirroring Trapper's
own Collection model, which needs nothing more than a name to create one).
Each deployment's own folder likewise gets a deployment.json with the
fields the wizard collected, since there's no Trapper database to register
them in."""
