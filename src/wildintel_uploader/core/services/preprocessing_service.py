"""Preprocessing the images as they are imported into their collection — what
wildintel-tools' prepare_collections_for_trapper did, and a bit more:

  - dates: each image's capture date is read from its EXIF (DateTimeOriginal,
    then the digitized date, then DateTime, then the file's own date), taken as
    the camera's local time in the deployment's timezone — optionally ignoring
    summer time — and converted to UTC.
  - rename: <DEPLOYMENT>__<YYYYMMDD>_<n>.<EXT>, all upper case, .jpg as .jpeg;
    n is the image's place in natural file-name order.
  - resize: to a width, keeping the proportions. Unlike wildintel-tools, where the
    resized image only ever fed the identifier's hash and the original was what
    got copied, the resized image is what is kept. Images no wider than the
    width are left as they are, and the EXIF and colour profile are kept.
  - metadata: XMP authorship, rights and license, written with ExifTool —
    including the hash of the original (Source) and of the image kept (Identifier).

A "preprocessing.json" beside the images records what was done to each one."""
