# WildINTEL Uploader

**WildINTEL Uploader** is an open-source desktop web application that takes the images of a
camera-trap deployment — copied off the camera's memory card — checks them, organizes them in a
local collections folder, and sends them to [Trapper](https://gitlab.com/trapper-project/trapper),
the WildINTEL project's camera-trap platform.

It runs on your own computer, with a guided interface in your browser — and a command line for the
quick jobs:

- **Import deployments** — one folder of images, or a session with one subfolder per deployment.
  The images are validated (corrupted, duplicated, out of order, mixed cameras…), the deployment's
  details are filled in and checked against the earlier revisions of its location, and the images
  are renamed, resized and tagged with authorship and license metadata. Your source folder is never
  touched.
- **Upload to Trapper** — pick a collection kept locally and send its deployments: the location and
  the deployment are created in Trapper if they are missing, and the images go up in zips for Trapper
  to process. A dry run says what would happen first.
- **Repair local deployments** — check which deployments of a local collection are still valid and write the
  metadata of the others again from what their folders hold.
- **Sync local collections** — bring the collections folder up to date with what Trapper already
  holds for a classification project.
