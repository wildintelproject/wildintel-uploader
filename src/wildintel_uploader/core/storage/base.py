"""What the app needs of where it keeps its records — and nothing about how they are kept.

The **records** are what the app keeps of a research project: the project itself and, for each, its *locations*, *visits*, *unknown visits*, *cameras*,
*SD cards*, *roles* and the *uploads that failed*. They are plain `dict`s — the JSON the app has always kept, with the fields its models give them — so anything that can keep a
list of them under a research project can be a backend: a folder of JSON files today, a database tomorrow (see `register`).

What is **not** a record stays where it is: the images and what is written beside them (a deployment's `deployment.json`, `images.json`, the logs of a collection…) are
files of the collections folder, not rows of a table.

The rules of the records — the instants of the visits, the dates `created_at` and `updated_at`, which location can be removed — are the services' (`local_folder_service`),
above this layer: a backend only keeps and gives back. It never has to know what a visit is.
