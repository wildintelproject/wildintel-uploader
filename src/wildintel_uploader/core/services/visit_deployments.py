"""The deployments a research project's visits say, and the logs of their collections — what the field records of a trip come to.

Each site's visits, in order, give a deployment for every pair of consecutive ones where the first left a camera (an Installation or a Revision) and
the second collected its card (see local_folder_service.closes_collection): the deployment goes from the one to the other, and is **closed**. It belongs to
the collection **the session of the visit that collected it names, minus one** (R0013 collects the deployments of R0012). A camera that was left and
has not been collected yet is an **open** deployment: it will belong to the collection the visit that collects it will name — the one being completed if it
was left before the last trip, the next one if it was left on it.

From the two visits of a deployment come its fields as Camtrap DP names them: who set it up, the camera and the card it was left with, the photos counted
when it was collected, and the details of the camera and the site. When the visit that left it and the one that collected it say something different of
a field, both are kept: a text as "Setup: … | Retrieval: …", the tags and groups of both together, and a number, a yes/no or a feature type as the setup says
it with the retrieval's value noted in the comments.

write_collection_logs() writes, in each collection's folder, the FileTimestampLog (the closed deployments' start and end) and the FieldworkLog (every
deployment of the collection, closed or open).
