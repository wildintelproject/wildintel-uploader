"""Opens the OS's native "choose a folder" dialog for the web UI's
"Browse…" button.

This is a local desktop app whose backend and frontend always run on the
same machine — the browser tab it shows itself in is just how the UI is
drawn (see web.app_entry) — so the backend can pop a native dialog on that
machine's own display. Rather than bundling a GUI toolkit (the PyInstaller
spec deliberately excludes tkinter, which is also awkward to bundle
cross-platform), this shells out to whatever dialog tool the platform
already ships with."""
