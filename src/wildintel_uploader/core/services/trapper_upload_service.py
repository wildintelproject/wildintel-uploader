"""Uploading a deployment kept in the collections folder to Trapper — what
wildintel-tools did in three commands, in one:

  1. the location and the deployment are created in Trapper's research project
     if they aren't there yet (the location from the deployment's own coordinates,
     the deployment from its details);
  2. the deployment's images are packed, as before, into a zip and the yaml that
     describes them (the deployment's resources and when each was recorded),
     split in several parts if the zip would be bigger than a size;
  3. each zip and its yaml are uploaded, and Trapper is told to process them into a
     collection.

The deployment must have been imported through the wizard's preprocessing: the
dates the yaml needs are the ones its preprocessing.json records.

Three modes: "upload" does all of the above; "dry_run" does the same reading
Trapper only — it says what it would create and how it would pack the images,
and changes nothing, in Trapper or on disk; "generate" only writes the files —
the zip(s), the yaml(s) and the collection's <collection>_deployments.csv — and
leaves them, for sending some other way."""
