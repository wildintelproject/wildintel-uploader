"""Repairing a deployment kept in the collections folder: if its metadata files are gone, or its seal no longer matches,
they are written again from what the folder itself holds.

    <collections folder>/<research project id>/<R0003>/<deployment id>/
        <images>, deployment.json, images.json, preprocessing.json, seal.json
    <collections folder>/<research project id>/<R0003>/<R0003>_FileTimestampLog.csv

A deployment is **valid** when its seal.json still matches it (seal_service.verify); anything else is not. Repairing it:

  - reads the capture date of every image (the camera's wall clock, from its EXIF) and its camera;
  - takes the deployment's period from the collection's FileTimestampLog.csv if the deployment has a row there — the log
    always prevails over what the images say — and, if it has none, from the deployment.json that is left or else from the
    images, and adds the row;
  - writes deployment.json (what is left of it, the location's details and the camera, plus that period), preprocessing.json
    and images.json, as the images are;
  - validates and postvalidates the images (and checks the preprocessing: their names, sizes and metadata) and writes a new
    seal.json with the result, and a report of it all.

What can't be known is left as it was or empty: the original name of a renamed image, and the options it was preprocessed
with, unless a preprocessing.json that is left says so. A deployment synced from Trapper is not touched."""
